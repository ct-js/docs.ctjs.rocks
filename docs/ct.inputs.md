# ct.inputs, ct.actions

This module (`ct.inputs`) allows you to manipulate [Actions](/actions.html). You can create, modify, or delete new actions during the game.

`ct.actions` stores existing actions. If you have created an action `Move`, then it will be available at `ct.actions.Move`. Each of them is an instance of JS class `CtAction`.

Here is a generic example on how to use actions in your game:

```js
/**
 * Move the copy around.
 * See "Project" > "Actions and input methods"
 * and "Actions" in the docs.
 */
this.hspeed = 8 * ct.actions.MoveX.value; // Move by X axis
this.vspeed = 8 * ct.actions.MoveY.value; // Move by Y axis
if (ct.actions.Shoot.pressed) {
    ct.templates.copy('Bullet', this.x, this.y);
}
```

## Actions' methods and properties

### ctAction.value ⇒ <code>Number</code>

A scalar value between -1 and 1. 0 means that there is no input at the current frame, e.g. all the gamepad's thumbsticks are in the resting position or all buttons were released. When used with a keyboard and mouse, actions' values will alternate between 0, 1, and -1 (if multipliers were used). Gamepad thumbsticks and other custom manipulators may produce other values.

### ctAction.pressed ⇒ <code>Boolean</code>
Returns whether the action became active in the current frame, either by a button just pressed or by using a scalar input.

**Returns**: <code>Boolean</code> – `true` for being pressed and `false` otherwise

### ctAction.released ⇒ <code>Boolean</code>
Returns whether the action became inactive in the current frame,
either by releasing all buttons or by resting all scalar inputs.

**Returns**: <code>Boolean</code> – `true` for being released and `false` otherwise

### ctAction.down ⇒ <code>Boolean</code>
Returns whether the action is active, e.g. by a pressed button
or a currently used scalar input

**Returns**: <code>Boolean</code> – `true` for being active and `false` otherwise

### ctAction.methodExists(code) ⇒ <code>Boolean</code>
Checks whether the current action listens to a given input method.
This *does not* check whether this input method is supported by ct.

**Returns**: <code>Boolean</code> – `true` if it exists, `false` otherwise.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | <code>String</code> | The code to look up. |

### ctAction.addMethod(code, [multiplier]) ⇒ <code>void</code>
Adds a new input method to listen.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | <code>String</code> | The input method's code to listen to. Must be unique per action. |
| [multiplier] | <code>Number</code> | An optional multiplier, e.g. to flip its value. Often used with two buttons to combine them into a scalar input identical to joysticks |

### ctAction.removeMethod(code) ⇒ <code>void</code>
Removes the provided input method from an action.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | <code>String</code> | The input method to remove. |

### ctAction.setMultiplier(code, multiplier) ⇒ <code>void</code>
Changes the multiplier for an input method with the provided code.
This method will produce a warning if one is trying to change an input method that is not listened to by this action.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | <code>String</code> | The input method's code to change |
| multiplier | <code>Number</code> | The new value |

### ctAction.update() ⇒ <code>Number</code>
Recalculates the digital value of an action.

**Returns**: <code>Number</code> – A scalar value between -1 and 1.

### ctAction.reset() ⇒ <code>void</code>
Resets the state of the action, setting its `value` to `0` and its `pressed`, `down`, `released` states to `false`.

## Creating and removing new actions programmatically

### ct.inputs.addAction(name, methods) ⇒ <code>CtAction</code>

Adds a new action and puts it into `ct.actions`.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
name|String|The name of an action, as it will be used in `ct.actions`.
methods|Array\<Object\>|A list of input methods. This list can be changed later.

**Returns:** `CtAction` – The created action

**Example:**

```js
ct.inputs.addAction('Move', [{
    code: 'keyboard.ArrowLeft',
    multiplier: -1
}, {
    code: 'keyboard.ArrowRight'
}, {
    code: 'keyboard.KeyA',
    multiplier: -1
}, {
    code: 'keyboard.KeyD'
}]);
```

### ct.inputs.removeAction(name, methods) ⇒ <code>void</code>

Removes an action with a given name.


| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
name|String|The name of an action

**Returns:** `void`

## Creating new actions without adding them to ct.actions

### new CtAction(name)
Creates a new ct action.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | <code>String</code> | The name of the new action. |
