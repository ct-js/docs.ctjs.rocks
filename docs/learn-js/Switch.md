# Switch

```
switch(expression) {
    case x:
        // code block
        break;
	case z:
		// code block
		// code continues in next block
    case y:
        // code block
        break;
    default:
        // code block
}
```

notice that the z code block continues into the y code block
because there is no ** break **

# IF

```
if (condition1) {
	//  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
}else if (condition2) {
	//  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
	//  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
```
