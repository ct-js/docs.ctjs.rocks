# Basic concepts

**Ct.js** is a modular library written in JavaScript, coupled with a visual editor. The editor is also referred to as **ct.IDE**. Games in ct.js are written in JavaScript as well: it is the programming language of the web, is flexible, easy to learn, and infinitely deep.

Any ct.js game consists of **textures**, **copies**, **templates**, and **rooms**.

* A **texture** is an image that doesn't do much by itself but is used by copies and can be drawn with code. This asset is also referred to as a sprite, but it can also be a tileset, a background, etc.
* A **copy** is a logical entity in your game that can interact with user inputs and other copies. Enemies, trees, bullets, gems, bonuses, cats â€” everything is a copy. Copies are often called *"objects"*, *"actors"* or *"instances"* in other game engines.
* Each copy corresponds to a specific **template**. A **template** is a template for new copies with common settings and behavior. It may be called a *class* or an *object* in other game engines.
* A **room** is a 2D space in your game where you place your copies. Rooms may have their own additional behavior (level scripts). Rooms are also often referred to as *levels* or *maps*. A notable difference is that rooms in ct.js are boundless when other 2D engines tend to set a specific size to it.

There are additional resources that help make games juicier, better, fun to play, and easier to develop:

* [**Actions**](actions.html) that combine different input methods into one API, so you can code once for keyboards, gamepads, virtual joysticks, and other stuff.
* **Catmods** are additional modules that hack on the core library and add new tools for programming and new features to the engine.
* **Custom fonts** allow you to use .ttf files in your games, so your game looks nice in every browser or PC.
* **Emitter tandems,** or simply particle systems, are flexible visual effects made of textures. Explosions, magic effects, rain, snow, and many other special effects may be made with these.
* [**Skeletal animations**](skeletal-animation.html) for skinnable characters with smooth animations.
* **Sounds** are audio assets that are played by code.
* **Styles** are templates for drawing labels that are used while making the user interface.
