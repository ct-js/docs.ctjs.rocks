## Using Custom Fonts (.ttf files)

As of version 1.3, importing and using custom fonts in styles is a bit confusing, so here's how to do it.


## 1. Import a font in the UI tab.

In the UI tab, click the "Import TTF" button to import a font file.

## 3. Set your typeface's name

In the font's settings, set your typefaces name to whatever you'd like to reference it by from the styles menu.
Then click Apply to save your changes.

## 5. Set the text style's name a font family.

Set your text style's name to whatever you want, and change the Font family to the following:

`pixel, CTPROJFONTpixel, sans-serif`

Change `pixel` to whatever you renamed your typeface.

## And you're done!

After you've clicked Apply, you can load in your fonts with `PIXI.text` like so:

`new PIXI.Text('your text', ct.styles.get('YourStyle'))`
